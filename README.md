# Soulsborne save manager
A fancy and lightweight save-file copier. Ths should be usable for any soulsborne games because they use the same saving method. (User\Roaming\AppData\Roaming\<Gamename>). 

This is a passion project. I lost my 80hrs save due to power outage. Never again.

## How to use

Download a [release](https://github.com/iaiaian1/Soulsborne-Save-Manager/tags) zip and extract anywhere you want then provide proper source directory. For Elden Ring it's around
```bash
C:\User\Roaming\AppData\Roaming\EldenRing
```
other soulsborne game store savefiles the same way. Select where you want to store the backup and the autosave. Copy-paste the filename of the save in save filaname textbox(ER0000.sl2 for ER). 

Do save option so your settings gets saved.

## What it does
Backup and restore the LATEST save file you backed up or autosaved. You can limit the autosave files to save space, do take note that it will delete the oldest file the moment the autosave surpasses the limit you set.
